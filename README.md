# LLM-Project-Using-LLAMA-2
 This project leverages the latest advancements in natural language processing and generative AI to automate the creation of engaging and informative blog content. By utilizing the LLAMA model, an extension of Meta's renowned LLM (Large Language Model), our blog generator produces high-quality articles.

# Requriments of tools/libraries in the context of my generative AI project Blog Generator:
## 1.sentence-transformers:
This is a Python library for generating sentence embeddings, which represent the semantic meaning of a sentence in a dense vector space.
Sentence embeddings can be useful for tasks such as semantic similarity comparison, clustering, and classification.
In the context of your Blog Generator, sentence-transformers could potentially be used for understanding the meaning and context of input text or for evaluating the coherence of generated blog posts.
